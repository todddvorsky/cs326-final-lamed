## Idea
Our idea is to create an app that curates a specific diet/recipes based on the type of workout you aim to do. You will have the option to curate a recipe yourself or cycle through random ones until you find one you like. Also includes the ability for users to curate their own workout or choose one that is given. While similar to MyFitnessPal, this app differs because it curates a diet for the user based on how they workout. This app takes a lot of different components from apps that already exist like LifeSum that mainly tracks your diet and MyFitnessPal that mainly tracks your workouts. The idea of our app is to combine these ideas into one central location, with more specific features mentioned below.

## Important Components
Users of this app will have their own credentials to login to their account in order to keep their data separate from other users. Within their
profiles, they will have the option to focus on just workouts, just diets/recipes/nutrition, or combine the two. When wanting to combine the two, users can pick a workout that they're currently focusing on and get a diet plan matched up with it, or vice versa if they're more in tune with their diet and want some help on the workout side of things. Users can also browse around on both the workout and diet sides if they're wanting a better idea of the app. While they'll always have the option to randomize options that match their desired profile, users can also customize their own diet or workout if they want to be very precise.

Assuming there will be multiple users of the app, users will be able to "like" sets of workouts/diets, workouts alone, or diets alone. Users can also comment on any set as well to give other users more insight. There will also be the option of looking at the price of diets given so users can get a better idea of diets that work better for their life. The diet/recipes will also include calorie counts and all nutritional data needed to gauge if it's the correct diet for you.
